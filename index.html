        <p>The tree missed the days the kids used to come by and play. 
            It still wore the tire swing the kids had put up in its 
            branches years ago although both the tire and the rope had
             seen better days. The tree had watched all the kids in
              the neighborhood grow up and leave, and it wondered if
               there would ever be a time when another child played 
               and laughed again under its branches. That was the hope
                that the tree wished every day as the swing gently 
                swung empty in the wind..</p>
